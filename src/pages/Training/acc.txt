Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) helps timely service for maintaining the equipment to reduce the breakdown time at shop floor. We offer two types of AMCs : Non-comprehensive AMC and Comprehensive AMC. Both are having their own advantages. Non-comprehensive AMC is a basic and periodic maintenance service but the spare part charges will not be our scope. Whereas Comprehensive AMC covers periodic maintenance and cost of standard spareparts. Though Comprehensive AMC cost you more, but we will be in a better position to maintain standard spares stock readily available to reduce machine breakdown time. Standard spares may include the spares which are having highest wear and tear rate and other consumbables. The cost of AMC differs from machine to machine, type and quantity in the plant, their usages and number of years used. We can provide you detailed quote only after knowing all the details.
